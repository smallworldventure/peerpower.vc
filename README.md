*Small Ticket Size and Rationale*

At PeerPower VC, we meticulously consider the investment ticket size for each startup, taking into account various factors. Typically, our suggested investment ticket size ranges from $50,000 to $250,000 per startup. Below, we elaborate on our rationale for these suggested investment amounts:

**1. Early-Stage Funding:**
   - **$50,000 - $100,000:** This range caters to very early-stage startups, providing vital capital injections to validate their concepts, build MVPs (Minimum Viable Products), and initiate initial market testing.

**2. Growth and Scaling:**
   - **$100,000 - $150,000:** Startups that have validated their product-market fit and are focused on scaling often require additional funding to expand their operations, acquire more users, and refine their business model.

**3. Development and Expansion:**
   - **$150,000 - $250,000:** As startups continue to grow and develop, they may require more substantial investments to fund product

 development, marketing efforts, team expansion, and market expansion.

*Rationale:*

**Diversification:** Offering a range of investment ticket sizes enables effective portfolio diversification. Smaller ticket sizes enable investments in a larger number of early-stage startups, increasing the chances of discovering promising ventures.

**Startup Needs:** We recognize that each startup possesses unique capital requirements. Our suggested ticket sizes align with the specific growth stage and financing needs of the startups we consider for investment.

**Risk Mitigation:** Smaller investments in very early-stage startups help mitigate risk by allowing us to observe a startup's progress and potential before committing more significant funds.

**Partnerships:** For larger ticket sizes, we often seek co-investment opportunities with other venture capital firms or strategic investors. This collaborative approach enables startups to access a broader network and pool of resources.

**Flexibility:** We maintain flexibility in our investment approach. Depending on the startup's potential and growth trajectory, we may adjust our ticket size to provide the optimal level of support.

Ultimately, our goal is to support innovative startups that align with our investment thesis and have the potential to create a positive impact in Cambodia's entrepreneurial ecosystem. Our suggested ticket sizes are designed to provide startups with the capital they need to thrive while ensuring prudent risk management for our investors.

*Larger Ticket Size for Attractive Investment Funneling*

Considering our desire to further strengthen our investment funnel and attract promising startups, we recommend introducing a larger ticket size of $500,000 for select investment opportunities. Here's the rationale behind this suggestion:

**1. Attract High-Potential Startups:**
   - A larger ticket size can attract startups that have already demonstrated substantial growth, achieved product-market fit, and are now seeking significant capital injections to rapidly scale their operations.

**2. Access to Later-Stage Opportunities:**
   - With a larger ticket size, we can explore investment opportunities in more mature startups that have moved beyond the early stages of development. These startups may already have a sizable customer base and revenue streams.

**3. Portfolio Diversification:**
   - By introducing a larger ticket size, we can diversify our portfolio further, allowing us to invest in a broader range of startups at different stages of growth.

**4. Competitive Advantage:**
   - Offering a larger ticket size can position PeerPower VC as an attractive investment partner for startups looking to secure substantial funding. This competitive advantage can help us secure deals with high-potential ventures.

**5. Scaling Opportunities:**
   - Startups often require significant capital to scale their operations, expand into new markets, or develop advanced features. A larger ticket size enables us to support them effectively in these endeavors.

**6. Co-Investment Opportunities:**
   - A larger ticket size also opens doors to co-investment opportunities with other venture capital firms or institutional investors. This collaborative approach can lead to more significant investments in startups with substantial growth potential.

**7. Economic Impact:**
   - Investing larger sums in startups can have a more significant economic impact, driving job creation, innovation, and economic growth in Cambodia.

**8. Alignment with Startup Needs:**
   - The suggested larger ticket size aligns with the financing needs of startups that have reached a stage where substantial capital infusion is essential for achieving their growth objectives.

While we propose introducing a larger ticket size, it's important to maintain flexibility in our investment approach. We will continue to evaluate each startup on a case-by-case basis, considering their unique needs, growth potential, and alignment with our investment thesis. This larger ticket size complements our existing investment strategy and enables us to tap into a broader spectrum of opportunities, ultimately contributing to the development of Cambodia's entrepreneurial ecosystem.

*Open for Co-Investment with Others*

At PeerPower VC, we recognize the immense power of collaboration and the value it brings to the startup ecosystem. Therefore, we are wholeheartedly committed to being open to co-investment opportunities with other venture capital firms, angel investors, and institutional investors. Here's why co-investment is an integral part of our investment strategy:

**1. Diversification and Risk Mitigation:**
   - Co-investing allows us to diversify our portfolio by spreading our investments across a broader range of startups. This diversification helps mitigate risks associated with individual investments.

**2. Access to Expertise:**
   - Collaborating with other investors brings diverse expertise and perspectives to the table. We can tap into the knowledge, networks, and insights of co-investors, enhancing our ability to support portfolio startups.

**3. Leveraging Resources:**
   - Co-investors often bring additional resources and support to startups, such as mentorship, strategic guidance, and industry connections. This can significantly benefit the startups in our portfolio.

**4. Larger Investment Capacity:**
   - Co-investment enables us to participate in larger funding rounds that might be beyond our individual capacity. This ensures that we can support startups at critical growth stages effectively.

**5. Enhanced Due Diligence:**
   - Multiple investors conducting due diligence can lead to a more comprehensive assessment of potential investments. This rigorous evaluation process improves our investment decision-making.

**6. Building Stronger Startups:**
   - Co-investment fosters an ecosystem of support around startups. When multiple investors are aligned in their goals, startups receive the necessary resources and guidance to thrive.

**7. Portfolio Growth:**
   - Co-investment opportunities can lead to an expanded portfolio of startups, allowing us to diversify across various industries, stages, and geographies.

**8. Industry Relationships:**
   - Collaborating with other investors helps us build relationships within the investment community, opening doors to future

 opportunities and partnerships.

**9. Regional Impact:**
   - Co-investing with other firms contributes to the development of Cambodia's startup ecosystem and the broader Southeast Asian region, fostering economic growth and innovation.

**10. Alignment with Our Mission:**
    - Our mission is to support and nurture promising startups. Co-investment aligns with this mission by providing startups with the collective resources and support needed to succeed.

At PeerPower VC, we see co-investment as a strategic approach to maximize the value we bring to startups while minimizing risk. We actively seek opportunities to collaborate with like-minded investors who share our vision of empowering Cambodia's entrepreneurial landscape.
